### About

I am not the creator of the original Excel list of questions. I found it on LinkedIn and used it as a structured roadmap for practice.

Here is the [Excel file](https://github.com/anweasha/sql-questions/blob/main/Solutions/SQL%20Questions.xlsx).


### Notes

Questions Q95 to Q141, Q154, and Q161 are part of the [LeetCode SQL50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) set.
These have already been solved in the following folder: [SQL 50](https://github.com/anweasha/sql-questions/tree/main/leetcode/SQL%2050)


- All **DataLemur** and **Codewars** questions were solved in **PostgreSQL**
- All **LeetCode** questions were solved in **MySQL** except:
    - **Q160**, which was solved in **PostgreSQL**
